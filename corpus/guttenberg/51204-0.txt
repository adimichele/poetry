_Introduction._


In the endeavor to make this book larger and better than any previous
edition we have called to our aid some of the best needleworkers and
designers in this country, and the result is that we have the choicest
collection of embroidery designs for home decoration it has ever been
our privilege to present.

We have been fortunate in securing the services of Mrs. Wilson, Mrs.
Haywood, Miss Morse, Miss Hallowell, and Mrs. Smith. Their designs are
always greatly admired, and undoubtedly many of our readers will prefer
to embroider their patterns, taking advantage of this opportunity to
study the treatment these well known authorities furnish for their
special designs.

Special attention is called to the Corticelli Colored Plates, which are
the only accurate reproductions of embroidery in natural colors ever
published. Aside from their beauty they will be found of great value to
every needleworker, as they show not only the correct shading of each
flower, but also the length and direction of the stitches.

We show several very attractive designs for knitted fancy tops for golf
and bicycle stockings, and the rules given are from practical patterns
knit from wool and silk.

To many needleworkers this may be the first Corticelli instruction book
they have seen. From such we invite the closest examination of our
goods, feeling confident that intelligent women can in this way readily
appreciate the superior quality of Corticelli Silk.

_Hints Upon the Selection of Material._


Often the most difficult task for many women is choosing the proper
shades of silk to embroider a certain stamped linen. Usually the dealer
from whom you purchase your Corticelli Silk will advise you in regard
to this, but when one lives in one of the smaller towns no store will
be found which carries a good stock of embroidery materials from which
to make a selection. In this case the best thing to do is to send
six 2 cent stamps to the Nonotuck Silk Co., Bridge Street, Florence,
Mass., for a Corticelli Color Card, showing over 325 different shades
in which Corticelli Wash Silk is made. The card also shows samples
of the various silks, as Filo Silk, Roman Floss, Persian Floss etc.
The owner of a Color Card can order by number Corticelli Silk from
her storekeeper, either by mail or in person. Few realize what a
convenience this is.

[Illustration: CORTICELLI COLOR CARD.

Mailed to any address for six 2 cent stamps.]

Many do not understand the great difference in embroidery silks, and
often inferior kinds are sold them by unscrupulous clerks. Corticelli
Silk is smooth working, of high luster, and is free from imperfections
in stock or finish, while the dyes used are remarkable for brilliancy
and absolute fastness of color. Magnificent mills, modern machinery,
and sixty years experience in manufacturing silk enable the Nonotuck
Silk Company to produce as perfect embroidery silk and floss as can be
made.

Many realize only too late that they should have been more careful
in buying the right brand of Wash Silk. The old saying, "The best
is always the cheapest," comes back to those who have had some
disappointing experience with a patiently worked centerpiece or doily
which failed to stand the final test--the test of washing. Corticelli
Silk took the highest award at the Cotton States and International
Exposition held at Atlanta, Ga., 1895, as well as first prize at the
Chicago World's Fair, 1893, and at the California Midwinter Exposition,
1894. Besides this we call your attention to the large number of well
known needlework authorities that recommend its use. These facts alone
should induce you to give Corticelli a trial in case you have never
done so.

For fine and delicate shading on any smooth closely woven material,
especially linen, use Corticelli Filo Silk (sometimes called Filo
Floss). Owing to its fine size and loose twist a skillful worker can
blend the shades with the utmost nicety, so that flowers, leaves,
fruits, or other objects are most faithfully reproduced.

Corticelli Persian Floss is a silk of two strands, loosely twisted and
of high luster, for work where two threads of Filo would ordinarily
be required. Persian Floss is used extensively for the buttonhole
edges of doilies and centerpieces, first padding the scallops with a
few stitches as shown in Fig. VI _a_, page 17; or the buttonhole edge
may be worked without padding as desired. Corticelli Filo Silk and
Corticelli EE Embroidery Silk are also sometimes used for this work.

Corticelli Roman Floss is somewhat coarser than Corticelli Persian
Floss and is intended for embroidering large designs on heavier
material. Curtains, counterpanes, and cushions are worked with this
thread, although for very bold designs Corticelli Rope Silk is
preferable.

Corticelli Etching Silk, as its name implies, is for outline embroidery
and etching. Corticelli Lace Embroidery Silk should be used for Honiton
and lace work of similar nature. Corticelli EE Embroidery Silk is best
suited for general fancy work and crazy patchwork. This silk is quite
hard twisted and is therefore very durable.


_To Wash Embroidered Linens._[1]

By L. BARTON WILSON.

Avoid all risk of rust or stain by using an earthen wash bowl in
preference to a tin or wooden tub. Wash by dipping in suds as hot as
the hand can comfortably bear, made with "Ivory" or any other pure soap.

If there are any spots on the article wash them out first, before
wetting the entire piece. Beyond this do not rub or fold, but plunge
the linen up and down in the suds. If it is very much soiled or yellow,
a half teaspoonful of borax may be added without the least danger to
the silk. Carefully avoid washing powders and cheap soaps. When clean
rinse by plunging up and down in several tepid waters or until the
water remains perfectly clear. If the soap is not entirely removed by
rinsing, the linen will yellow quickly.

Dry partially by laying between two soft cloths or towels for a few
minutes. A new and very successful method for drying and pressing,
especially small sized linens, is as follows: Lay them close and smooth
on a marble slab or board. The woof and warp should be drawn perfectly
straight and the stitches of the embroidery should be brought into
position--that is, so they will lie as placed when worked. To dry a
large article, place a sheet on the carpet and pin the piece through
it to the carpet straight by the edges, stretching a little. The drying
may be hastened by fanning or by holding a hot iron within half an inch
of the surface. Doilies pinned to a board or frame may be dried in a
minute by holding them in front of a register, and thus treated they
should need no pressing with an iron.

Larger linens may be placed on a fine sheet, face downward, and
"touched up" with a moderately hot iron; the marks of the pins may
be removed by dampening and pressing. Imperfections in the linen's
smoothness may be dampened but the silk should not be wet. The hem will
likely need firm pressing; fringe should be brushed and lightly combed
out; it will then likely need a little trimming.

All Corticelli Silk will remain fast in color if these directions for
washing are followed, and the laundered embroidery will appear no
different from that just finished. The peculiar luster, or bloom, of
this beautiful silk will be retained if the new method of quick drying,
under tension, is carried out.

To set embroidery for the first time, dampen the linen and silk on
the wrong side and dry quickly before removing from the hoop. In all
cases of fabrics that are not washable set embroidery by pasting on the
reverse side.


_The Size of Needle to Use._

BY MLLE. G. CORSINI.

Many ladies who embroider frequently complain that wash silk does not
work smoothly, that the silk snarls or ravels, making a bad-looking
piece of work, without saying anything about trying one's patience.

"Now, what makes my silk snarl?" is heard only too often. They
frequently assign the cause of the trouble to the silk, when, in
reality it is the fault of the needle they are using.

Some teachers recommend the use of an ordinary sewing needle with a
round eye, but I prefer the long eye or "Crewel" needle. If you want
to do fine work, shading closely, and are using double (two threads
of) Corticelli Filo Silk, use a No. 8 "Crewel" needle. For single
(one thread of) Corticelli Filo Silk use a No. 9 or a No. 10 needle,
depending on the material upon which you are working. Generally
speaking, use a No. 10 needle, especially for bolting cloth, Chinese
linen, or grass linen. Corticelli Persian Floss requires a No. 8
needle. In working Corticelli Etching Silk choose a No. 7 needle. For
Corticelli Roman Floss use a No. 6 needle. Use a No. 3 or a No. 6
needle for Corticelli Rope Silk.

Harper's Queen Crewel Needles are the best, and I advise all
needleworkers to insist upon having them.

By following the above instructions there will be no excuse for
unsatisfactory working of Corticelli Silk.

    NOTE.--If you cannot buy the needles you want in your
    city, send six cents to the Nonotuck Silk Company, Bridge Street,
    Florence, Mass., and they will send you four Queen Crewel needles
    each, of sizes 7, 9, and 10.


_Silk Required to Work a Piece of Given Size._

As a matter of fact no two needleworkers will use the same quantity of
silk to work the same centerpiece or doily. One will require nearly
or quite twice as much as another, perhaps, owing to the method of
treatment or the way the shading is done. It is therefore almost
impossible to advise customers just how much silk they will need.

In nearly all the instructions we have given the maximum quantity of
silk required to embroider a 22 inch centerpiece. You may not need as
much as the directions call for. Of course smaller sizes of linen will
take less silk to work them, and the necessary quantity can readily be
estimated.

If you are in doubt as to how much material you will want, you can
order from your dealer one skein of some shades, and two of others,
even if the instructions called for three or four skeins of a shade,
and then order again when you find you will require more. However,
it is always safer to buy at one time all the silk necessary for one
piece, and we cannot too strongly recommend this plan.


_Points for Beginners._

Embroidery is very fascinating work, but to attain perfection one
must study the subject. We have been fortunate in securing so well
known an authority on Art Needlework as Mrs. L. Barton Wilson to
furnish a chapter on Embroidery Stitches. This article, which even the
experienced worker will be glad to read, is especially valuable to
beginners, who will find no difficulty in making the different stitches
by following the directions and examining the illustrations.

Beginners should read "Hints upon the Selection of Material," and "The
Size of Needle to Use," as well as "To Wash Embroidered Linens." In
shading flowers in which many colors are required, have a separate
needle threaded with each shade; in fact, this is a good plan even if
you are using only a few shades.

Choose a simple design to begin with, such as a Violet, a Buttercup,
or a Daisy, and get a small size stamped linen, not over nine inches
square. At the end of the instructions for each design we have
printed the words (Easy), (Not Difficult), (Somewhat Difficult), or
(Difficult), which show the degree of skill necessary to embroider each
piece successfully.

No printed instructions can help a beginner as much as a lesson, or
better still a course of lessons, under a good teacher. However, we
have tried to make the instructions explicit, and we think further
details will be unnecessary; still, should you find trouble in working
any of the designs, or want to know where materials can be obtained, we
will gladly answer questions and give you any desired information. A
stamp should be enclosed for reply.

_Embroidery Stitches.--Described and Illustrated._[2]

By L. BARTON WILSON.


The stitches used in modern embroidery are not productions of this age.
They belong to the art of to-day through adaptation. They have a value
because of their antiquity far above any value which new inventions
in this line could possess. Their application has been tried without
limit and the extent of expression and delineation through them is
well known. The science of embroidery is established; its methods are
perfected. The art is rich in its heritage.

With the revival of needlework has naturally come a demand for silks of
such quality and durability as that possessed by the wonderful threads
of centuries ago, which are found in a perfect state of preservation
in many examples of old embroidery, and which seem even to grow more
mellow and beautiful in color with age. What modern science has done to
meet this demand is shown by the brilliancy and beauty of shading, and
fastness of color, which such silks as the "Corticelli" are known to
possess. This ought to be among the chief inspirations to best efforts
in this line of decorative art.

The form of embroidery which is most truly artistic, and at the same
time scientific, is that known as "Opus Plumarium"[3] or "Feather
Stitch." (The so-called "seamstress feather stitch" should not be
confounded with this.) The exceedingly beautiful 16th century examples
of the embroidery still in existence prove what is its durability and
how adequate the method. The "long and short" stitch, which is the
constituent of the work, is widely used on linens. When this stitch
is correctly laid the effect is very beautiful, and, like all primary
things, its beauty lies in its simplicity and perfect adaptability. It
is proposed to describe and illustrate the long and short stitch first,
in order that in the light of a clear understanding of this first
principle, the opus plumarium (which is considered the most difficult
embroidery, but which is really an advanced use of this simple element)
may become less formidable to amateurs.

Feather stitch should never be attempted on an unframed fabric. A
certain degree of excellence may be attained in embroidery by working
such fabrics as linen in the hand, but perfect stitch direction and
proper tension cannot be secured unless the fabric is stretched.

Embroidery stitches hold a certain definite relation to each other and
may therefore be classified into groups. A glance at the classification
will give one a clear idea of the fundamental principles of the Art. A
little study of it will furnish the key to the forms and styles of the
embroideries of the different centuries and countries and so enable one
fully to appreciate collections of antiques which are invaluable to the
learner.

                                 { _d._ Border Stitch.

The above table will be found of great value to beginners, enabling
them easily to master the scientific or theoretical as well as the
practical part of this article.

"Long and short" stitch as commonly used on linens is a border work.
That is, the forms of the design are not filled in entirely; the
stitches are carried round the outline and such space as they do not
cover within the form is allowed to remain in a low relief. This is
known as "half work," sometimes as "half solid Kensington," while
the solid "opus plumarium" is often called "Kensington." While it is
true that the Kensington school revived this ancient embroidery it is
doubtful if this is sufficient reason why it should give to it the
name. The history of art will be better preserved if we adhere to the
old terms. The effect of the contrasted surfaces, through the half
work, of the ground material and the embroidery, is very pleasing,
and such a method is more suitable on linen than solid embroidery.
It is less conventional and therefore is in harmony with the fabric.
On the other hand solid embroidery is rich in itself and should be
used to decorate rich fabrics. This is not an _invariable_ rule but
its restrictions are reasonable. Such exceptions as these may be
noted,--tiny forms such as the fronds of maiden hair fern may be made
solid to advantage, and the Bulgarian embroidery, fully described
elsewhere in this book, is heavy and complete. Conversely, good effects
are sometimes obtained with _heavy_ silks in half work on rich fabrics.
The artistic principle involved in the "half work" is suggestiveness.
If the design is good to start with, a great deal of spirit may be put
into it by the simple border embroidery.


I. "LONG AND SHORT" STITCHES.

[Illustration: FIG. I _a._ SIMPLE LONG AND SHORT
STITCH.]

_A._ =_Simple Long and Short Stitch._=--This stitch may be done in
the hand, but as already intimated it can be _perfectly_ done only in
a frame or hoop, which should be rested on the table edge and held by
a weight. The material should be stretched straight with the woof and
warp. The stitches are then laid by using both hands, one below and the
other above the frame, to send the needle up and down perpendicularly.
To make the stitch, bring the needle _up_ on the outline of the design
and send it _down_ within the form. When the fabric is held in the
hand the needle takes the stitch over and down on the outline and _up_
within the form. Let the first stitch be a long one, one-quarter of an
inch to an inch in length in proportion to the size of the form. The
next stitch should be but two-thirds as long and should lie parallel
with the first or closer to it within the form, if it is a narrowing
one, than on the outline; or vice versa, if it is a form increasing
in width. The contour of the design must decide the stitch direction.
The third stitch should be long, followed by a short one, and so on
alternating long and short. We are sometimes told that these stitches
should be "irregular." This is both true and it is not. The long
stitches should certainly not be all of one length and the short all
of another. In this they should vary, but they should be absolutely
regular in that they should be even on the surface without piling or
yet having spaces between them, and they should form a perfect unbroken
surface and the edge should exactly coincide with the outline. This,
then, is the "long and short" stitch, and it may be considered complete
in itself as far as it goes. It is the first stage of solid embroidery
or "opus plumarium." See Fig. I _a._

[Illustration: FIG. I _b._ FEATHER STITCH.]

_B._ =_Feather Stitch._=--The next step is to lay another row of
stitches over these, differing from them in that they shall be long and
short on both edges. The long stitch should commence just below the
outline and should end further within the form than any of the first
row. It should be taken in exactly the same direction as the first
row and over them. The next stitch should be started below the first,
something less than a third of its length, just beside it, and should
reach the same distance below the end of the first. The third should
be similar to the first, and so on. It is obvious that every other
stitch of this second row is the long one at its start and the short
one at its finish. The second row is the same as the first, except
that it is long and short on both edges. This is not "irregularity,"
but _absolute regularity_. The more regular and the more accurate the
alternating is, the smoother the surface will be. This second row
should lap well over the first. It should indeed cover two-thirds of
it if the colors are to blend instead of appear as rows. This is the
secret, or rather, the real principle of shading. It will not do to
economize material and expect a rich result. This is likely to be the
fault of American embroidery. The preceding rows of stitches must be
solid under the succeeding ones. There may be as many rows as are
necessary to cover the form, and these should all lap deep over each
other so that the under rows show only because of the difference in
length of the stitches of the upper edge of the over rows. In this way
one shade passes into the next as tones in painting, perfectly clear
in themselves yet, because they are distinct, making a luminous and
unbroken whole. If the stitches are not placed according to such a
method the effect will be--again as in painting when the colors are
muddled--broken and harsh and expressionless. By this means shades that
differ greatly can be blended and the whole is brought into relief by
the raising of one row over the other. The lower ends of the stitches
of the last row may adapt themselves in terminating to the form. See
Fig. I _b_.

[Illustration: FIG. I _c._

OVERLAP STITCH.]

_C._ =_Overlap Stitch._=--This is the "long and short" on a
curved _line_, not form. The first stitch is taken from the end of
the line along its length, the next stitch is taken just below the
start of the first on the line, over to the other side of the first
and to a point just above the finish of the first, thus lapping.
Continue these stitches long and short. This is the way to work round
the circumference of a circle. Curved tendrils are very effective
embroidered in the overlap stitch. See Fig. I _c._

[Illustration: FIG. I _d._ TAPESTRY STITCH.]

_D._ =_Tapestry Stitch._=--A stitch similar to feather stitch
except that its lines are all in one direction. The stitches do not
slant to accommodate themselves to a form but are all straight and
in all cases parallel and terminate abruptly as they come against
the outline of the form whether they are within it or are used to
fill the background. This is essentially a filling stitch and is the
most beautiful way to embroider backgrounds. In composition with opus
plumarium it is wonderfully rich. There are many superb examples of
this work in the old opus anglicanam, where it was largely used to
represent drapery, and, in its most perfect application, faces. In a
word it is _parallel_ "opus plumarium." Its rows should be well lapped.
See Fig. I _d._ The light shade in the engraving is intended simply to
show the system of stitches; there are three rows, each worked in the
same color, completely covering the linen and presenting an absolutely
smooth surface.

[Illustration: FIG. II _a._ SIMPLE SATIN STITCH.]

The above four stitches are based upon the "long and short" element.


II. SATIN STITCHES.

_A._ =_Simple Satin Stitch._=--The next stitch in importance is
the "Satin Stitch," and it has various applications. This stitch forms
an unbroken surface not only in effect but in reality. The stitches
are taken parallel and from side to side of the outline or over the
space they are to cover. On coarse material and with one of the heavier
silks, such as Corticelli Roman Floss or Rope Silk, it is possible
to make them quite long, but when fine material is used they must be
short to lie well. Embroidery in this stitch is more or less mechanical
and does not allow of shading. It is used principally in narrow bars,
which are often first raised by stitches laid at right angles to the
direction the satin stitch is to take. We show two very good examples
of satin stitch.

[Illustration: FIG. II _a._

SIMPLE SATIN STITCH.]

_B._ =_French Laid Work._= The French white or laid embroidery
is an especial application of the satin stitch. It is the method of
initialing and is done in the Corticelli EE Twisted Embroidery Silk and
Corticelli Etching Silk with best effect. It is also the form of work
for covering cartoons in church embroidery. The stitches may be taken
from side to side at any angle so that they are kept parallel to each
other.


III. COUCHING STITCHES.

[Illustration: FIG. III _a._

SIMPLE COUCHING STITCH.]

_A._ =_Simple Couching Stitch._=--As methods of work, appliqué and
couching are of great importance and possibility and through them a
large variety of stitches are employed. Designs cut out of fabrics are
applied to ground fabrics by couching. The simple stitch taken at right
angles over cords is the one most commonly used, as shown in Fig. III
_a_. This and other couching may be used independently or on the edges
of applied forms.

[Illustration: FIG. III _b._

TWISTED STITCH.]

_B._ =_Twisted Stitch._=--In this stitch one cord is twisted
around another and the over stitch is taken through the ground at right
angles to the direction of the outline. See Fig. III _b_. Two silk
cords may be carried over outlines, one each side of a gold thread.

[Illustration: FIG. III _c._ BRICK COUCHING STITCH.]

_C._ =_Brick Couching Stitch._= Lay rows of cords close to each
other and couch them down with perpendicular stitches, alternating in
each row with the spaces between them. This is very effective work. See
Fig. III _c_.

_D._ =_Diaper Couching Stitch._= This work is done over satin
stitch. Many examples of it are to be found in the rich antique
diapered work. This embroidery has many uses in modern work. (See
article on Bulgarian Embroidery.) Circular forms within conventional
flowers may be covered with satin stitches as long as the forms
require, then cross-barred with stitches placed at a decided angle from
the satin work. This set of cross-bar stitches should be recrossed with
another at the opposite angle, thus forming little squares over the
first work, which should be couched down at their intersections. This
diapering over satin embroidery may be done in a variety of designs
and color combinations. Original ways will suggest themselves to the
worker. See Fig. III _d_.

[Illustration: FIG. III _d._

DIAPER COUCHING STITCH.]

_E._ =_Elaborate Couching Stitches._=--There are a large number of
elaborate couching stitches usually executed in gold and purse twist.

The old work is rich in examples of couching over a system of
foundation cords which raise the covering layer of cords or silk
threads. The "Basket" and the "Frill Basket" are the most beautiful
of these stitches. Corticelli Filo Silk should generally be used for
the over stitch and the heavier silks, such as Corticelli Roman Floss
and Rope Silk, should be the threads laid on the surface. When it is
desired to have the over stitches invisible yet strong the Filo Silk
may be split and waxed.


IV. OUTLINE STITCHES.

[Illustration: FIG. IV _a._

KENSINGTON OUTLINE STITCH.]

_A._ =_Kensington Outline Stitch._=--Outline stitches, especially
the one known as "Kensington outline," form a very prominent part
in the work on linens. When the lines of designs are close very
satisfactory results are obtained by outlining alone. This embroidery
is very serviceable, and a housekeeper needs an ample supply of the
simple linens to insure freshness in the dining room and about the
toilet tables. Linens outlined in all white are very dainty, and all
blue or delft green monochromes are pretty for summer. The outline is a
hand embroidery stitch, so that the work is very convenient. The point
of care-taking lies in the fact that the outline must be accurately
followed. The stitch itself is a reverse backstitch. The work should
proceed from left to right. The needle should be brought up in the
outline, drawn out the full length of the thread, then sent down in
advance and carried out on the outline again a short distance in
front of the point at which it was put in. Again the needle should be
sent through in advance on the line, thus forming an unbroken, partly
double line on the face and a series of short backstitches on the wrong
side of the fabric. The thread must be kept always on one side of the
needle. It is more convenient to some workers to throw it back. See
Fig. IV _a_.

[Illustration: FIG. IV _b._

BULGARIAN STITCH.]

_B._ _=Bulgarian Stitch.=_--Two or more lines of outline stitch
laid parallel and close together is known as "Bulgarian Stitch." See
Fig. IV _b_.

[Illustration: FIG. IV _c._ SPLIT STITCH.]

_C._ _=Split Stitch.=_--An outline backstitch with the needle
brought up _through_ the previous stitch instead of beside it. See Fig.
IV _c._

[Illustration: FIG. IV _d._ STEM STITCH.]

_D._ _=Stem Stitch.=_--This is also but a modification of the
outline. The backstitches are taken so as to slant slightly _in_
towards the interior of the form, thus giving a little width to the
outline. It is necessary to take the stitches a little closer than the
cut would indicate in order to avoid spaces between them. This is a
very satisfactory way of working stems when it is desired that they
should have more width than the simple outline would give. See Fig. IV
_d._

[Illustration: FIG. IV _e._ TWISTED OUTLINE STITCH.]

_E._ _=Twisted Outline Stitch.=_--This stitch should be worked in
a frame or hoop, and it will be found a most effective way of working
ribbed stems. A double thread of Filo is best adapted to the work. The
thread should be brought up on the outline its full length above the
framed fabric and the needle turned in the fingers until the thread is
well twisted, then holding the twisted thread over the fore-finger of
the left hand send the needle down a quarter of an inch in advance on
the line; bring it up again close beside the stitch thus laid, about a
third back on its length, then send it down again in advance. The width
of the stem should be covered with parallel lines of these stitches.
One line is not satisfactory, but two or more lie well together. The
stitches must be taken uniformly all on one side of the lines. They may
be much longer than those of the simple outline. See Fig. IV _e_.


V. WOUND STITCHES.

_A._ _=Simple French Knot.=_--A very useful little stitch,
especially for flower centers, where it may be used to cover small
spaces or may represent the anthers. The thread is brought out its full
length and twisted round the needle near the point where it leaves the
fabric, the needle point is then inserted perpendicular to the ground,
the twist drawn against it and the needle pushed through to the eye.
Before drawing it through, the middle finger of the right hand should
be placed on the twist to insure the knot's lying firm on the surface.
Turn the thread around the needle but once for a fine knot or several
times for a coarse one. The simple French Knot is shown in Fig. V _b_.
by the single knot at the left of the illustration.

[Illustration: FIG. V _b._ FRENCH KNOT, COMBINED WITH
STEM.]

_B._ _=French Knot, Combined with Stem.=_--The French Knot with
tiny stern is made as one stitch. Instead of placing the knot at the
point where the thread leaves the ground material, it is placed at a
desired distance with the thread laid in a simple stitch on the ground
surface. This is a very satisfactory way to work flower centers. The
stamen, both filament and anther, is thus one stitch. See Fig. V _b_.

[Illustration: FIG. V _c._ BULLION STITCH.]

_C._ _=Bullion Stitch.=_--Made by twisting the thread on the
needle. When a coil is so formed the needle and thread are drawn
through it; it is then placed on the surface and the needle sent down
through the ground material to fasten it. This is a Turkish stitch and
in that embroidery is usually done in gold passing. See Fig. V _c_.


VI. BUTTONHOLE STITCHES.

[Illustration: FIG. VI _a._

SIMPLE BUTTONHOLE STITCH.]

_A._ _=Simple Buttonhole Stitch.=_--The Buttonhole Stitch is
capable of more elaborate work on its own account than is generally
supposed. Aside from the buttonhole scallop shown by Fig. VI _a_. which
is now so popular as a finish on linens and for which the Corticelli
Persian Floss and Corticelli EE Twisted Embroidery Silk are so
suitable, it has many possibilities in large work. It is also a hand
stitch and surfaces can be covered rapidly by its use, two points most
acceptable to amateurs. Short stitches laid close carry better color
effects than long ones far apart, although the color of the background,
which shows through the long stitches, has a large influence upon
the effect. Deep stitches in the buttonhole work must have a certain
proportionate space between them, for stitches more than a quarter of
an inch deep do not lie well close together. The line on which the loop
is to fall should be held toward one. The needle should be put in on
the opposite line of the width of the space to be covered and brought
out directly below on the lower line. The thread should lie in front of
the needle and under it, so that as it is drawn through and the stitch
laid the knot will lie formed. The work is done from left to right and
the stitches should be kept perpendicular. See Fig. VI _a_.

[Illustration: FIG. VI _b._ BLANKET STITCH.]

_B._ _=Blanket Stitch.=_--A wide-apart loose buttonhole stitch
used principally on flannels. Corticelli Etching Silk or Corticelli EE
Twisted Embroidery Silk is best suited for this work. See Fig. VI _b_.

[Illustration: FIG. VI _c._ HONEYCOMB STITCH.]

_C._ _=Honeycomb Stitch.=_--An adaptation of buttonhole stitch,
and is very nice for large work such as portieres. The first row of
stitches is laid like the blanket buttonhole, quite loose. The next
is fastened to the fabric only at the beginning and end of the row;
between these points the loop stitches are caught into the loops of the
first row, and so on with the succeeding rows, fastening through only
where the rows terminate against the outline. It is necessary to keep
the stitches very loose, as each row has a tendency to narrow. When
the form is covered draw the last row in place and fasten it by a row
of buttonhole stitches taken through the fabric like the first. It is
possible to work back and forth. It is well to reverse the needle and
send it through the loops eye end first, to avoid splitting the silk.
The same form of stitch may also be taken through the material. See
Fig. VI _c_.

[Illustration: FIG. VI _d._

DOUBLE BUTTONHOLE STITCH.]

_D._ _=Double Buttonhole Stitch.=_--A very pretty way of treating
narrow bars from one-half to three-quarters of an inch wide is to use
the double buttonhole stitch. Bring the needle up in the center of the
width of the bar the full length of the thread and take the regular
buttonhole stitch from this point over the upper line to a point a
little above the start; draw this stitch through. The point of the
needle in this case was directed _down_. Now put in the needle on the
lower line of the bar and send it _up_ to a point a little below the
start and a trifle to the right; keeping the thread to the right. Draw
the stitch through and proceed to make another from above like the
first, always keeping the thread to the right to form the loop. The
effect of this is that of a satin stitch on the top and bottom of the
bar with a braided line through the center. It is very effective and
pretty. The braid may be made wider by making the stitches shorter. See
Fig. VI _d_.

[Illustration: FIG. VI _e._

LADDER STITCH.]

_E._ _=Ladder Stitch.=_--Many of the lace stitches are buttonhole.
The "Ladder" for instance is two rows of buttonhole stitch a short
distance apart and parallel, connected by regular overcast stitches.
The ground material is cut away between the rounds or overcast lines.
The honiton lace is applied by buttonhole stitch, using Corticelli Lace
Embroidery Silk. Fig. VI _e._ shows the so-called ladder.

[Illustration: FIG. VI _f._ CAT OR BRIER STITCH.]

_F._ _=Cat, Brier, Coral, or Seamstress Feather Stitch.=_--An
alternate buttonhole loop first to the right and then to the left. The
loops may be alternated singly or in pairs, or in threes or fours. It
is almost too well known to need explanation. See Fig. VI _f_. (Also
see Sofa Pillow Design No. 508.)


VII. CHAIN STITCHES.

The chain stitches are closely related to the buttonhole stitches.

[Illustration: FIG. VII _a._

COMMON CHAIN STITCH.]

_A._ _=Common Chain Stitch.=_--The common chain stitch may be said
to be the buttonhole stitch carried down a line by its length instead
of from left to right proceeding by its width. The consecutive stitches
are started from within the lower end of each preceding loop; a line of
link-like loop stitches will thus be formed. See Fig. VII _a_.

[Illustration: FIG. VII _b._ ROPE STITCH.]

_B._ _=Rope Stitch.=_--This is a modification of the common chain
stitch. It is commenced the same as the chain but the successive
stitches are taken by sending the needle down back of the last-loop
instead of through it. The loop is formed as in the chain. This makes
a very pretty ridged line when done in heavy silks such as Corticelli
Roman Floss or Rope Silk. See Fig. VII _b_.

[Illustration: FIG. VII _c._ SINGLE REVERSE CHAIN
STITCH.]

_C._ _=Single Reverse Chain Stitch.=_--To outline with the Reverse
Chain Stitch it is necessary first to lay a simple stitch on the
surface; bring the needle up below the end of this, at a distance of
the length of a stitch from it; now pass the needle, eye first, behind
the first stitch, not through the fabric; then draw through the length
of the thread, insert the point of the needle close beside the point
where it came up, and bring it out below again, the distance of the
length of the preceding stitch; again pass the needle back of the chain
loop, just laid, as it was in the first place passed back of the simple
stitch; continue these laid loops along the line to be covered. See
Fig. VII _c_.

[Illustration: FIG. VII _d._ DOUBLE REVERSE CHAIN
STITCH.]

_D._ _=Double Reverse Chain Stitch.=_--To form the double reverse
chain proceed in the same way to the point of the first "single reverse
chain stitch," but instead of sending the needle down the distance
of a stitch below, insert it the same but bring it out just to the
right or at about the point where the thread leaves the fabric. Draw
this tiny stitch through and pass the needle again back of the simple
stitch, thus forming a double loop. Send it down again on the point
to the left of the start and out the length of a stitch below on the
outline. The next stitches are taken in the same way, passing the
needle back of the loops as in the first case back of the simple
stitch. See Fig. VII _d_.

[Illustration: FIG. VII _e._ DOUBLE CHAIN STITCH.]

_E._ _=Double Chain Stitch.=_--Formed by laying two rows of simple
chain parallel to each other and catching them together by a regular
over stitch passed through the inner edges of each of the two rows
alternately. See Fig. VII _e_.

[Illustration: FIG. VII _f._ CABLE STITCH.]

_F._ _=Cable Stitch.=_--Similar to the rope stitch. The difference
lies in sending the needle down a little below the point where the
thread leaves the ground material at the base of the loop instead of
back or within the loop. This forms a chain of open links. See Fig. VII
_f._

[Illustration: FIG. VII _g._ BEADING STITCH.]

_G._ _=Beading Stitch.=_--A chain stitch taken horizontally over
the thread as it is carried along an outline, thus forming a knot at
regular spaces on a seemingly placed line of the silk. See Fig. VII _g_.

[Illustration: FIG. VII _h._ BIRD'S EYE STITCH.]

_H._ _=Bird's Eye Stitch.=_--Formed like the chain loops
but grouped about a center. Small radiating devices can be very
successfully embroidered in this way; the effect of small petals as in
daisies is very good. The loop is fastened by a tiny stitch at its base
and the needle again brought out at the center. See Fig. VII _h_.

The "Tambour Stitch" is the chain executed with a small hook, which is
pushed up and down through the fabric. It is a Turkish embroidery and
very like machine work. There are various other modifications of these
chain stitches.


VIII. DARNING STITCHES.

Darning is a very satisfactory sort of embroidery. In this work the
greater part of the silk is laid on the right side of the material so
that it carries large masses of color. Darning is generally considered
a filling embroidery and is often used in background work. Backgrounds
darned around a design may be made very artistic.

[Illustration: FIG. VIII _a._ SIMPLE DARNING STITCH.]

_A._ _=Simple Darning Stitch.=_--The simple darning stitch is
a short stitch on the back and a long one on the face "running" on
a straight line, the second row alternating with the first in the
positions of the long and short stitches, and lying parallel to it.
Care and practice are necessary to make these rows of equal tension.
They should keep their straight direction and terminate where they meet
the outline. There are ways of accommodating them to the outline when
they are used within the design. See Fig. VIII _a_.

[Illustration: FIG. VIII _b._ BRICK DARNING STITCH.]

_B._ _=Brick Darning Stitch.=_--If it is desirable to increase the
color effect the first series of rows may be crossed at right angles
by a similar series. This is known as the "Brick Darning Stitch." The
straight bars should be laid by darning one way and back, alternately.
By a little planning very pretty coloring may be gained through
relating the background shade to the imposed work. See Fig. VIII _b_.

_C._ _=Seed Stitch.=_--This may be considered a darning stitch,
having however the short stitches on the surface and the long ones on
the back. This is largely used in combination with satin stitch for
lettering. (See Designs Nos. 612 A, B, D, E, and F.)

[Illustration: FIG. VIII _d._

QUEEN ANNE STITCH.]

_D. =Queen Anne Stitch.=_--Another form of darning is the "Queen
Anne Stitch." In this the silk is not sewed through the fabric but
first laid in long parallel lines from side to side of the outline,
then crossed at right angles by weaving in threads alternately. This is
rather mechanical and not so artistic as the first method, though we
may see very curious examples of it in the old English embroideries.
See Fig. VIII _d_.


IX. FANCY STITCHES.

There are many other so-called "fancy stitches." Among them the pretty
"Herringbone" and its modifications are worthy of note.

[Illustration: FIG. IX _a._ HERRINGBONE STITCH.]

_A._ _=Herringbone Stitch.=_--A short stitch taken from right to
left, and as it proceeds the thread is drawn to the right and the work
is carried in this direction. It is essentially a cross stitch. See
Fig. IX _a_.

[Illustration: FIG. IX _b._ ISMIT STITCH.]

_B._ _=Ismit Stitch.=_--A slight difference in the plan of taking
a stitch changes the entire effect. This is obvious in the "Ismit
Stitch." It is taken exactly as the herringbone and the radical
difference in the result is due simply to making the lines meet at
a point. See Fig. IX _b_. When the lines are very long they may be
fastened by couching stitches at the intersections.

[Illustration: FIG. IX _c._ JANINA STITCH.]

_C._ _=Janina Stitch.=_--A very satisfactory way of filling in
the petals of conventional flowers or flower forms. It may be used
with really beautiful effect on the canvas materials with Corticelli
Roman Floss or Rope Silk. It is also a good method for filling bars
on borders. While it is not heavy unless worked close, it carries a
decided color effect. It is one of the prettiest of the conventional
stitches. See Fig. IX _c_.

[Illustration: FIG. IX _d._ BORDER STITCH.]

_D._ _=Border Stitch.=_--This stitch is not unlike herringbone.
It is however carried perpendicularly, while herringbone proceeds
horizontally. The side or fastening stitches of the border work are
very short. See Fig. IX _d_.


_"Doily" or "Doiley."_

The Inland Printer, a journal devoted to the printing and publishing
trades, and a magazine generally considered authority on questions
of orthography gives the proper spelling as "doily." The following
explains itself.

Question.--Kindly give us the correct spelling of the word variously
printed as "doily" and "doiley," and also the plural of the same. There
has been considerable discussion in regard to the proper way to spell
this word, and we will leave you to render the final verdict.

Answer.--Our final verdict in this case is simply that of all the
dictionaries. Every one of them enters the word as "doily," and
they are right in doing so, because, though the name from which it
is derived was variously spelled as "Doily" and "Doyley," and maybe
otherwise also, it is well to select one spelling--presumably the
prevalent one--for the common name. At any rate, this is what the
lexicographers have done, and no good reason to dissent from their
choice is apparent. The plural of the form chosen is "doilies."

    645; 4 skeins 612. Dealers can furnish stamped linen of this design
    in 22 inch size. They can also furnish stamped linen 7 and 9 inches
    square of the set of three doily designs (Nos. 55A, 55B, 55C), to
    match this centerpiece. See page 92.


[Illustration: BULGARIAN CENTERPIECE DESIGN NO. 55.]

The Bulgarian embroidery as we know it on the brown linen squares
is valuable chiefly for its durability and pleasing coloring. These
squares embroidered in the bright cottons make beautiful cushions
and their use with Turkish rugs and hangings is very appropriate.
The stitching is effective rather than accurate. The figures of the
characteristic designs are crude, but they are full of suggestions and
it is possible in carrying out these to obtain most graceful and dainty
drawings. When they are adapted to fine white linens and embroidered in
silks the result is at once orientally rich and sufficiently dainty for
table use.

Heavy colorings are more and more to be urged for centerpieces and
doilies which are to be placed under gas light. The color combinations
for this set may seem at first startling, but when the shades are
properly distributed the result is rich and harmonious.

[Illustration: BULGARIAN DOILY NO. 55 A.]

Border.--Buttonhole the scalloped edge in blue and gold brown
Corticelli Etching Silk, using shades 626 and 645 alternately for each
scallop. One connecting scallop should be blue and the next one yellow.
The inner edge of scallops should be outlined in Black Etching Silk,
612, also the straight lines enclosing the scroll and the bars of the
doilies. The same Blue, 626, in Corticelli Filo Silk with Brown, 526,
may be used for the scroll. Keep the blue on one edge and the brown on
the other. Embroider in the "overlap" long and short stitch. Work the
little trefoils within the scallop in satin stitch with Pink, 128, 130,
and cross-bar them alternately with the scallop colors. See Colored
Plate VII.

[Illustration: BULGARIAN DOILY NO. 55 B.]

[Illustration: BULGARIAN DOILY NO. 55 C.]

Flower and Leaf Forms.--These should carry the colors of the edge with
a few in addition. Use in the leaf forms, in combination with Brown,
526, 527, and 528, the Greens 123, 125, and 126. In the flower forms
use beside the blue and yellow, Pink, 128 and 130, and Red, 542 and
544. The leaf forms should be embroidered in long and short stitch.
The flower forms may be made altogether or nearly solid or filled with
feather stitch or satin stitch diapered. The satin stitch may be done
in Filo Silk cross-barred with the Etching Silk. Distribute the colors
in masses, that is, confine certain colors to certain forms, _combine_
the colors rather than mix them. The effect of cross-bar diapering in
the flower forms of these figures is very pretty and the work is firm
as well.

Corticelli Filo Silk alone should be used in the figures of the doilies
even for the cross-barring, though the scallops and black lines should
be of the Etching Silk. It is possible to introduce the red into the
doily scallops in the little connecting points and to so combine the
colors as to make all the edges different. Four of each of the doily
designs form the dozen, and these may be still further varied by a
little planning as to color schemes. The centerpiece and doilies may
be embroidered with good effect in simple outline or rows of outline,
known as the "Bulgarian stitch." If desired the entire work on the
centerpiece may be done with Corticelli Etching Silk, and the effect
will be really very beautiful, and novel as well, but the figures of
the doilies are too small for such treatment. (Not Difficult.)

    skeins each 655.7, 525.7, 525.8, 525.9, 655.8, 655.9, 656, 780; 1
    skein 115. Corticelli Persian Floss, 8 skeins 780.

    _Materials_--9 inch Size: Corticelli Filo Silk, 1 skein each of
    above shades. Corticelli Persian Floss, 2 skeins 780. Dealers can
    furnish stamped linen of this design in 9, 12, 18, and 22 inch
    sizes. See page 92.

It has been aptly said of Japanese designers that they know how to
occupy a space without filling it, thus producing very beautiful
effects with little labor. This remark applies well to this design,
since it can be quickly worked, and it will prove very charming and
effective for either a centerpiece or doily.

[Illustration: JAPANESE DESIGN NO. 51.]

Border.--Work in indented (long and short on the inside) buttonhole
stitch in two shades of pale soft green. For the outside edge use
Corticelli Persian Floss, 780; into this blend Filo Silk, 779.5, still
keeping the indented effect in the shading.

Almond Blossoms.--Work solid, beginning the edges of petals with
Corticelli Filo Silk, 656, shading lighter to the center, using 655.9,
655.8, 655.7. In the center of the flower make French knots in Golden
Brown, 115.

Stems.--Work solid in shades of Golden Brown, 525.7, 525.8, 525.9. The
shading should be darker near the flowers and at the bottom of the stem
than elsewhere. Use the lighter shades for working the small stems
branching out from the main stalk.

Calyx and Small Buds.--Use Green, 780, for the upper part and Brown,
525.7, near the stems.

The work should be pressed before the edge is cut. If desired a double
strand of Corticelli Filo Silk may be used for working the blossoms
and stems. Great care must be taken, however, not to allow the strands
to twist around each other. They should lie side by side, giving their
full value. Even when working with a single strand great attention
should be paid to keeping it from twisting. Keep it in its normal
condition by occasionally untwisting; otherwise it will become like a
wisp and all the beautiful gloss of this lovely silk will soon be lost.

[Illustration: PANSY DESIGN NO. 605 B.]

Pansies always have a peculiar charm of their own, and as subjects for
embroidery afford opportunity for very skillful, as well as artistic,
treatment. The range of color is so varied and the possibility of
pleasing combinations is so great that the following instructions are
given simply as a suggestion. However, the directions will be found
ample for the less experienced needleworker who does not care for a
color scheme of her own.

Border.--Work the scallop in buttonhole stitch with Corticelli EE
Embroidery Silk, White, 615; or Persian Floss, 615, can be used.

Flowers.--Work solid in combination of Purple, 725, 726, 727, 728,
729, 729.5, and Yellow, 740, 741, 742, 743, 743.5, 743.7. It would be
effective to work some flowers all in purple, others in yellow with
purple rays. Commence with the two upper back petals of the open flower
nearest to the border. Work the edge of the petal with Yellow, 743;
shade into that 743.5, 743.7, and use 645 near the center for shadow.
Begin the edge of the three lower petals with 743, shading lighter to
the center with 742, 741, 740. See Colored Plate I (Frontispiece). To
lend variety the three lower petals in some yellow flowers can be made
lighter on the edge and darker toward the center.

From the center of the flower, extending into the three lower petals
make rays of Purple, 729. Work a few solid stitches of Scarlet, 766, in
the center of the flower. Now begin with the two upper back petals of
the purple flowers using 728 for edge of the petal, shading gradually
darker to the center with 728, 729, and make a few stitches of 729.5 in
rays, and as shadows. Begin the edge of the lower petals with 725 and
gradually shade darker to the center, making rays in the three lower
petals with 729.5. Work a few solid stitches of Scarlet, 766, in the
center of the flowers. See Colored Plate I (Frontispiece) for shading
and proper direction of the stitches.

Buds and Calyx.--Work the buds solid, using 727, 728, 729. Work the
edge with 727 and shade gradually darker to the stem, using a little
of 729.5 near the stem. Work the points of the calyx in Green, 781,
shading toward the stem with 782 and 754.

Leaves.--Work the points of the leaves solid, in 780, shading gradually
darker toward the midvein and base of the leaf, using 781, 782.
(Difficult.)


_Garland Wild Rose and Forget-me-not Design No. 54._

BY ALICE C. MORSE.

    _Materials_--22 inch Size: Corticelli Filo Silk, 2 skeins each 623,
    624, 637, 638, 639, 640, 741, 742, 805, 806; 1 skein each 504,
    625, 626, 780, 807, 808. Corticelli Persian Floss, 8 skeins 616.5.
    Smaller pieces take less silk. Dealers can furnish stamped linen of
    this design in 18 and 22 inch sizes only. See page 92.

This garland design when embroidered will be a surprise to any one
who has never tried a similar pattern. The coloring has a very rich,
subdued tone which is quite different from that found in any other
style of design.

Border.--Work the scallop in buttonhole stitch with Corticelli Persian
Floss, 616.5.

Wild Roses.--Work solid, using all the shades of Pink Corticelli Filo
Silk, 637, 638, 639, 640, working the edge of the petals dark, shading
gradually lighter toward the center of the flowers. Use three shades in
each flower. Vary the flowers, making some darker than others. In the
center work four or five stamens with one thread of Filo, 780, and at
the end of each stamen make a French knot with Yellow, 504. (See Photo
Frame No. 60.)

[Illustration: GARLAND WILD ROSE AND FORGET-ME-NOT DESIGN NO.
54.]

Forget-me-nots.--Work in satin stitch with Blue, 623, 624, 625, 626.
Don't try to shade each petal, but get light and shade effect by making
some petals in 623, some in 624, etc. Use 626 for an occasional petal
only, as the color is rather strong. Work in the centers one French
knot with 742.

Leaves.--Work solid with Green, 805, 806, 807, 808. Make the larger
leaves in the darker shades; the points of the leaves in 805. Veins and
stems work with 808.

Ribbons.--Work in satin stitch, slanting across the ribbon, using
Yellow, 741, 742. To give the effect of the twisted ribbon, work one
turn of the ribbon with 741, the next fold with 742, and so on. If you
prefer, Green, 125, 126, 127, can be used for the ribbon, carrying out
the same idea as directed above. (Somewhat Difficult.)

663 for the center. Work six or seven stamens in 781, putting three
small stitches of Yellow, 506, at the end of each to form the top or
head. Work the point of the buds with Green, 692.8, shading darker with
661, 662, 663, to the stem. See Colored Plate X.

Leaves.--Work solid, with Green, 781, for points, and shading gradually
darker with 782, 783, and 784 to the stem. The leaf is worked straight
from the point without veins. Use Green, 782, for the stems. When well
done the shading in this design is very delicate. (Not Difficult.)

with Corticelli Filo Silk, Purple, 676, shading toward the bottom of
the petal with 652, 651, 650, 726, 725. Begin back edge, or lip, of cup
with 651, shading darker toward the center with 652, 676. Do the front
lip in similar manner, but use 650 for the edge and 651 to shade toward
the center. Under the lip make the shadow with 676. From the center of
the cup make a pistil in Green, 781. Careful study of Colored Plate XI
will show the proper shading and correct direction of the stitches.

Leaves.--Work solid, using 780 for the point and shading gradually
darker with 781, 782, 783, 784. Work the stems near the flower, with
783, shading darker with 784 toward the base of stem. (Somewhat
Difficult.)

Green, 781, and around these stitches make a few French knots in 781
also. For the back petals of the buds use 507, shading lighter to the
stem with 506, 505. Use Green, 582, for the points of calyx, and shade
573 into the stem, using this shade also for a part of each stem.

_Conventional Wild Rose Design No. 52._

By EMMA HAYWOOD.

    _Materials_--22 inch Size: Corticelli Filo Silk, 4 skeins each 106,
    107, 108, 109; 3 skeins each 101, 102, 103, 105; 2 skeins each
    525.7, 525.8, 525.9; 1 skein each 113, 647. Corticelli Persian
    Floss, 8 skeins, 616.5.

    _Materials_--9 inch Size: Corticelli Filo Silk, 1 skein each of
    above shades. Corticelli Persian Floss, 2 skeins, 616.5. Dealers
    can furnish stamped linen of this design in 9, 12, 18, and 22 inch
    sizes. See page 92.

This dainty design of semi-conventional roses and leaves is quite
unique in style. For the handsomer kinds of embroidery there is a
decided leaning toward conventionalized forms, but many of the designs
offered are so intricate and stilted as to be hardly practical. This,
however, is both rich and graceful, with the added attraction that it
is not difficult to work. The treatment, as well as the design, is
somewhat conventional.

Border.--Work the scallop in buttonhole stitch with Corticelli Persian
Floss, Cream White, 616.5.

[Illustration: CONVENTIONAL WILD ROSE DESIGN NO. 52.]

Roses.--For the roses we suggest a most delicious new shade of pink
Corticelli Filo Silk, 101, 102, 103, 105. Take the darkest for the
curled over edge, working in a slanting direction. The outer edge,
however, should not be put in until the middle part is worked, so that
the edge can be worked over it. The inner part should be graduated,
putting the lightest next to the center so that one begins with 103
next the outer edge; 104 is left out so as to make a more decided break
from the curled over edge. The round center is very effective worked in
pale Gold Color, 113. This is covered with a network of crossed bars in
a dark, rich shade of Brown, 647, and outlined with the same.

Leaves.--The leaves are worked mainly with a soft shade of green, but
to avoid monotony golden brown is blended into the green at frequent
intervals, sometimes half a leaf is brown, sometimes it is tipped with
brown on one or both sides, or a little brown is worked in at the base
of the leaf. For the green shades take 106, 107, 108, 109, and for the
golden brown use 525.7, 525.8, 525.9. The stems and thorns are likewise
put in with the three shades of brown. In working the leaves let the
stitches take the direction of the veins; by this means the veining
will be expressed much better than by putting it in. (Not Difficult.)

This is a very effective design, pleasing in coloring, and capable of
very artistic treatment.

Floss, White, 615, with a long and short (indented) effect on the
inside line. Work the under scallop with Corticelli Filo Silk, 678,
using two threads in the needle. See Colored Plate IV for coloring and
method of working border.

[Illustration: CORTICELLI JAPANESE CHRYSANTHEMUM DESIGN NO. 609
B.

COLORED PLATE XVII.]

Flowers.--Work the back petals in 672, 673, 674, making the points
dark and the shading lighter toward the center. The petals in the
foreground should be made as follows: points in 672, shading lighter
toward the base with 678, 655.7, 616.5. See Colored Plate XVII. Work
the buds solid. Use 674 for the back petals of buds and for those in
the foreground; use 672 for points, and shade lighter to the calyx,
using 678, 655.7. Work the calyx solid in Green, 781 and 782.

[Illustration: JAPANESE CHRYSANTHEMUM DESIGN NO. 609 B.]

Leaves.--Begin the edges with 781, shading gradually darker to the
center with 782 and 783. Make some lighter by using 780 on the edge and
782 for the darkest shade. Vein with 783. For the stems use Green, 782,
783, and 755, working solid and making the end of the stem darker than
the part nearest the flower. (Difficult.)

method of working border.

Thistles.--Work the thistle with Corticelli Filo Silk, Purple, 672,
726, 727, 675, 729. Make each strand very fine and make each with
as much of a feathery effect as possible. At the top of the thistle
use 672, 726, and a little of 727. Make the upper part light; near
the center use the darker shades, 675, 727, 729, but use 675 and 729
sparingly. Work the bulb of the thistle solid in Green, 781, 782, 783,
784. Near the top of the bulb work one or more rows, according to the
size of the bulb, with Green, 782; the next two rows near the middle of
the bulb, with 781, then gradually darker to the bottom near the stem.
Another way to work the bulb is to work it solid with Green, 781, and
cross-bar with Bronze Green, 852.

Leaves.--Work solid. Make one spray of leaves with Green, 781, 782,
783, 784. Use 781 for the points of the leaves and shade darker toward
the center. Vein with 782, 783, 784. For another spray of leaves use
754, 684, 685, 686, working in the same manner as described above.
Work the stems in stem stitch with 784, giving quite a slant to the
stitches. (Not Difficult.)

white with one thread of Corticelli Filo Silk, 692.8., making an even
line or finish on the narrow part of the scallop but leaving an uneven
edge at the points. Shade these points with a few stitches of 692.9,
thus giving them a darker effect.

Four Corners in Border.--Work the cross-bar in outline stitch with one
thread of Corticelli Filo Silk, 692.8. Make a cross stitch with 692.9
where the lines intersect. Stuff the two jewels with cotton, or, better

_Purple Clematis Centerpiece Design No. 56._

AND SET OF 4 DOILIES, NO. 56A, 56B, 56C, AND 56D.

COLORED PLATE XXII.

BY ELIZABETH MOORE HALLOWELL.

[Illustration: PURPLE CLEMATIS CENTERPIECE DESIGN NO. 56.]

    _Materials_--22 inch Centerpiece: Corticelli Filo Silk, 4 skeins
    785; 3 skeins 784; 2 skeins each 725, 726, 727, 728, 729, 783;
    1 skein each 621, 622, 779.5, 780, 781, 782. Corticelli Persian
    Floss, 8 skeins 615. Smaller pieces take less silk. Dealers can
    furnish stamped linen of this design in 22 and 27 inch sizes. They
    can also furnish stamped linen, 9 inch square, of the set of four
    doily designs (Nos. 56A, B, C, D), to match this centerpiece. See
    page 92.

One can always do better embroidery, as is the case in all branches of
art, if thoroughly familiar with one's subject; then the mind, which
is really the source of intelligent work, can act through the pencil,
the pen, or the needle, and give to the result the added touch of
knowledge at first hand. Therefore, if possible, before working this
design secure a spray of the real clematis, choosing the variety known
as _Clematis Jackmanni_, which is probably one of the best known.

The Purple Clematis blossoms in June, July, or August, according to
the climate, but it can be secured from florists during other months.
Notice that the flowers often have four petals, and nearly as often
_five_. This is a marked peculiarity of the plant. Observe also the
buds and sprays of leaves, starting from the axils of the branches; the
curling tendency of the stems, by which tendril-like quality the plant
climbs. Sometimes the leaves will drop off from these stems, leaving
occasionally what looks like a real tendril, but what is in reality the
leaf-stem.

This centerpiece may be worked in heavy outline, which produces a very
decorative effect with less labor, but this is not recommended, the
design being of a large and handsome flower, which calls for stronger
and more lasting treatment, and the instructions given therefore
are for solid embroidery, in long and short stitch. (See article on
Stitches--"Feather Stitch.") While purple is the usual color of the
flower, it is sometimes very pale lavender, but for a decorative
design merely, the flowers might be worked in white with greenish
shadings.

[Illustration: CLEMATIS DOILY NO. 56 A.]

Flowers.--Begin the edge of petals with Purple, 729, shading gradually
lighter toward the base of the petal, using 728, 727, 726, 725. The
lightest shades should come into a vein in the center of the petal. For
the under side, or turned over parts, of the petals use 725 and 726.
The contrast between the color of upper and under sides is very marked.
Work the pistil solid, using 781 for the upper and 782 for the lower
half. See Colored Plate XXII.

[Illustration: CLEMATIS DOILY NO. 56 B.]

Centers.--Outline the stamens with Green, 780, 781. Make the outer
stamens, which are heavier than those inside and somewhat irregular,
with a double thread of Corticelli Filo Silk, and the inner stamens
with a single thread. At the point of each stamen make a French knot
with Purple, 729. Use 780 and 781 also for the center from which the
petals have dropped. Work the buds solid, in 725, 726. At the base of
each shade into the stem a few stitches of 780.

[Illustration: CLEMATIS DOILY NO. 56 C.]

Leaves.--Work solid in long and short stitch, with 779.5, 780, 781,
782, 783, 784, 785, being careful to slant the stitches in the same
direction as the veins, that is, from the edge in toward the central
vein, but sloping toward the base of the leaf. Shade from light on the
edge to dark near the midvein, See Colored Plate XXII. The leaves are
large and many shades can be used with advantage. Work some of the
smaller leaves in lighter shades than the large leaves at the bottom
of the spray. The veins in the leaves should not be indicated too
distinctly. They are shown with clearness in the illustration so that
the correct direction may be easily followed. One shade lighter than
the darkest shade used in the leaf will be correct for the veins. For
the turned over parts of leaves use 780 or 781.

Stems.--Work solid in 783, 784, 785, and where the stems are largest
use a little Reddish Brown, 621, 622. The stems from buds, also the
tendrils, should be made in 782, 783, 784.

[Illustration: CORTICELLI PURPLE CLEMATIS DESIGN NO. 56.

COLORED PLATE XXII.]

Border.--Work the scallop in buttonhole stitch with Corticelli Persian
Floss, White, 615, or if desired use Light Green Persian Floss, 780. If
fringe is wanted buy the 27 inch square of stamped linen, buttonhole
the edge very fine and even all around with Corticelli Etching Silk.
Then fringe the linen to the buttonhole edge, comb out the threads
evenly and trim to any length wanted. (Not Difficult.)


_Purple Clematis Doily Designs Nos. 56A, 56B, 56C, and 56D._

[Illustration: CLEMATIS DOILY NO. 56 D.]

Three of these doilies are designed so that the decoration will show
even should a tumbler or a finger bowl be placed upon them, and if six
or a larger number of doilies are desired for a set, repeat these three
patterns. In the fourth design, No. 56 A, the decoration is confined
to the center of the doily, this being intended for a bread or cake
covering, or for any purpose where a central decoration is most useful.
The instructions given for the clematis centerpiece will be ample for
working these doilies. (Not Difficult.)

    linen of this design in 9, 12, 18, and 22 inch sizes. See page 92.

Jewel embroidery is more than ever popular, and deservedly so, not only
on account of the scope it gives for daintiness of design, but more
especially because of the splendid possibilities in the arrangement
of color. Of course one is not slavishly tied to copying the exact
color of any particular gem; the decorator's license is available here
just the same as in reproducing flowers, an artistic and harmonious
scheme of color must be the first consideration. Unless the jewels be
of unusual size it is better to work each individual gem in one shade,
varying the tone if repeated in the same group. It must be remembered
that embroidery, like any textile fabric, to a great extent shades
itself, especially when the surface is glossy. In this style of design
it is well to introduce as great a variety of coloring as possible,
avoiding however very violent contrasts.

[Illustration: JEWEL EMBROIDERY. FILLING AND COVERING.]

We suggest a scheme that will be found to work beautifully, but many
others might be thought out with equally good results. It should be
observed, however, that in formulating a scheme all the colors employed
should be chosen in about the same tone to avoid the spottiness so
often found in amateur work; the very best designs can easily be
spoiled through inattention to this rule. The task of following exactly
the directions given is rendered easy by means of the numbers on the
labels attached to each skein of Corticelli Silk and by reference to
Colored Plate XXIII.

The work is solid throughout except where the scallops are filled in
beneath the scrolls with crossed bars; these are laid in place from
side to side, and caught down at each intersection. The jewels are put
in with satin stitch. (See article on Stitches.) They should be raised
a little by filling. This can be done in two ways, either by filling
one way in satin stitch and crossing the filling in the opposite
direction in finishing (see engraving), or by working a circle in stem
stitch and following the circle inside until quite filled in, then
covering with satin stitch. When covering the filling, always start
in the center and work out each way. It will then be found easy to
preserve the form. It is hardly worth while to use a different kind
of silk for the filling; it is poor economy and saves very little
after all, while the additional fastenings off are liable to make the
work lumpy. The jewels are more pronounced if outlined, but this is
optional. If outlined, a rich Burnt Sienna shade, such as No. 646, will
be very effective and not at all heavy. The jewels should be worked
with Corticelli Filo Silk.

For the four sections composed of scrolls, and for the scallop exactly
beneath them, choose three delicate shades of Apricot, 809, 810, 811.
Use the lightest in Corticelli EE Embroidery Silk for the scallop, and
shade the scrolls with the three tones in Filo Silk. Put in the crossed
bars with Green Filo Silk, 752.9, and catch them down with 753. The
outside scrolls are also worked with 752.9. The small scrolls at the
apex and on either side, also the upper bars in stem stitch, are of a
golden hue, for which take 113, 114. The large central jewel and those
heading the golden bars, are green. Use 700 for the large one and 701
for the small ones; those on either side on the bars are Violet, 650;
the three below and one above the large center jewel are also worked
with 650; the remaining single gems on either side of the center are
Red, 656. See Colored Plate XXIII.

[Illustration: CORTICELLI JEWEL DESIGN NO. 50.

COLORED PLATE XXIII.]

We now come to the intervening forms embracing three scallops. Work the
lily forms with Filo Silk in three shades of Blue, 786, 787, 788. Work
the three scallops in Persian Floss, with Blue, 786. The jewels are
golden, being worked with Filo Silk, 113, 114. The diamond shaped jewel
is put in with 812, representing a pink topaz. (Somewhat Difficult.)

    page 92.

These designs are especially adapted for beginners. The 7 and 9 inch
sizes make pretty doilies, and the larger linens work up into very
attractive centerpieces, tray cloths, and bureau scarfs.

Flowers.--Sweet Peas are always difficult owing to the great variety
of shades found in the flower. Begin the edge of the two upper petals
with Corticelli Filo Silk, Pink, 128, shading darker to center with 129
and 680. For the lower petals use the same shades; at the base work a
few solid stitches of Green, 123 and 124, for calyx. For a purple and
yellow flower begin the edge with Yellow, 501, into which shade Purple,
725, and near the base, or where the petals meet, use 726.5 and 727.
For the turn over part use 725. The buds should be darker than the open
flowers. Carefully examine Colored Plate XXVII, before beginning to
embroider this design.

Leaves.--Work the leaves in 123, 124, 126, shading from light on points
to dark near the center and base of leaf. Work the stems and tendrils
in 123, 126, using the former for the ends of tendrils only. (Somewhat
Difficult.)

Filo Silk, Blue, 518, 519, 521, are the forget-me-not shades. Make
an occasional petal in Pink, 678. Put one or two French knots in the
center of every open flower with Yellow, 504. Work the buds darker than
the open flowers. Use Green, 781, for the calyx.

Leaves.--Work solid, beginning the points with 781, shading darker to
midvein with 783. Work the stems in outline stitch with 783. (Easy.)


_The "Queen" Embroidery Hoop._

Most professional needleworkers use a large frame, and work with
both hands. For amateurs a hoop is the next best thing. Mrs. Haywood
recommends the "Queen" hoop. It is, in fact, quite superior to the
ordinary wooden or rubber ones. It is a smooth wooden hoop, true in
circle, with rounded edges; the outer hoop is a stiff spring wire band,
interlaced with braid. This hoop requires no wrapping for either light
or heavy material as the spring band will keep the goods stretched to
a uniform tension. It is made in 4, 5, 6, and 7 inch sizes, and can be
had at nearly all dry goods stores.

_Maréchal Niel Rose Design No. 602 B._

COLORED PLATE XXIV.

[Illustration: MARÉCHAL NIEL ROSE DESIGN NO. 602 B.]

BY AMALIA SMITH.

    _Materials_--22 inch Size: Corticelli Filo Silk, 2 skeins each
    615, 616, 616.5, 740, 741, 742, 780, 781; 1 skein each 692.8, 743,
    743.5, 782, 783, 784. Corticelli Persian Floss, 6 skeins 615.
    Smaller pieces take less silk. Dealers can furnish stamped linen of
    this design in 18 and 22 inch sizes. See page 92.

For the more experienced worker this design has many attractions,
and aided by the Colored Plate many who otherwise would be unable
to embroider this rose will find no difficulty in following the
directions. It is as handsome a design as the most ambitious could
desire, affording opportunity for very artistic treatment.

Border.--Work the scallop in buttonhole stitch with Corticelli Persian
Floss, 615. For the flowers in the border choose Corticelli Filo Silk,
615, shading to center with Green, 692.8. Put a few French knots of
Yellow, 742, in the center. Or work the centers of these border flowers
in Yellow, 740, instead of Green, 692.8, shading outward with 616.5 and
616.

Large Rose.--Begin the edge of some of the petals with Corticelli
Filo Silk, Yellow, 743.5, shading gradually lighter to 616 at base.
The edge of the other petals can be done with Yellow, 740, shading
darker toward base with 741, 742, 743, 743.5. The turn over petals must
be raised high by filling in with long stitches of Corticelli Roman
Floss, although darning or embroidery cotton can be used; over this
filling work Filo Silk, Cream White, 616, care being taken to slant the
stitches in almost the opposite direction from those in the rest of the
petal. See Colored Plate XXIV. In working the roses remember to use the
darker shades for the back petals, as well as for the hollows or deep
places and choose the lighter shades for the high-lights or the raised
parts, such as turn over petals and those on the outside.

Buds.--Work solid, using 743.5 for the point of the buds, shading
lighter toward calyx with Yellow, 743, 742. Work the points of calyx
with Green, 780, shading darker toward the bulb with 781, 782, 783,
784.

Leaves.--Work solid. For edge of some of the leaves use Green, 781,
shading toward the center with 782, 783. Vein with 784. For the
smallest leaves 780 can be used for the points, shading toward the
center with 781, 782, and veining with 783. A study of Colored Plate
XXIV will repay one, as it gives the shading of the leaves as well as
of the roses. (Difficult.)


_Rabbit Chafing Dish Design No. 53._

COLORED PLATE XXVI.

[Illustration: RABBIT CHAFING DISH DESIGN NO. 53.]

    _Materials_--22 inch Size: Corticelli Filo Silk, 2 skeins each 134,
    136, 137; 1 skein each 105, 140, 534, 561, 645, 646, 647, 656,
    779.5, 781, 782, 783, 784. Corticelli Persian Floss, 8 skeins 781.
    Smaller sizes take less silk. Dealers can furnish stamped linen of
    this design in 9 and 22 inch sizes. See page 92.

Border.--Work the scallop in buttonhole stitch with Corticelli Persian
Floss, Green, 781. See Colored Plate XXVI.

Rabbits.--The rabbits can be worked in outline, or a better way would
be to work them partly solid. These instructions are for the partly
solid work. Begin working all around the rabbits' ears in long and
short stitch with Gray, 134; shade 105 into the gray, and inside the
ear use very light pink, 534. Around the eyes and nose make irregular
stitches with 136, working the eyes solid with Pink, 656. A few
stitches will give expression. Choose 137 for the back of the rabbit,
and, using long and short stitch, slant the stitches a little toward
the tail downward. Now shade lighter to the side, using 136, 134. Begin
the under side of the rabbit with 137, and with 136 and 134 shade
lighter upward and toward the center in the direction the fur would
seem to take. Shade under the head and bend of the legs with 137. Care
must be taken in working the rabbits to give the right direction to the
stitches, otherwise the effect will not be good. See Colored Plate XXVI.

Grasses.--Work solid in long and short stitch with Green, 779.5, 781,
782, 783, 784, and Bronze, 561, 140, making each spear of grass of one
shade.

Scrolls.--Work in outline stitch with Brown, 645, 646, 647, shading
from light at end to dark at base. (Somewhat Difficult.)




_Photograph Frames._

_Directions for Mounting and Framing._


Embroidered frames are now always mounted under glass. This preserves
both the needlework and the picture, besides greatly enhancing the
beauty of both. After carefully examining all ready made frames in the
market we recommend the "Imperial Passepartout Frame" as the best.
It is strongly and yet neatly made, having a white leather binding,
holding the glass firmly in place. It has a sliding back, with
strong gilt wire easel, and suitable cardboard mounts with die cut
openings for pictures. It is self-contained and absolutely dust proof.
The embroidered linen can be removed at any time and a new design
substituted. These frames are made in two sizes, viz.: 8 x 10 inches
and 10 x 13 inches; the former has an opening for one photograph; the
latter, openings for two pictures. Square or oval openings are used
according to the design of the stamped linen. See page 92.

After the embroidery is finished, proceed to complete the frame as
follows: cover the face of the frame with cotton wadding, and lay the
embroidered linen on top, being careful to see that the design is in
proper position, the plain part being over the opening in the frame.
Draw the linen tightly and tack with pins on each corner. Now place
the frame on its face, stretch the linen over its edges and fasten it
on the back with good, strong glue or mucilage,--glue is preferable.
Be careful to draw tightly and avoid creases. Allow plenty of time to
dry; then with a sharp penknife, cut the opening, if it be a square
one, making four cuts from the center to each of the four sides of the
opening, thus: X. Draw the four pieces cut through the opening and
paste them on the back. If the opening is an oval, begin at the center
and cut the linen in slits toward edge; draw tightly and evenly and
glue down. Place the photograph in position over the opening; over this
put the cardboard, which will hold the picture in place. Clean the
glass and slip the linen, cardboard and all, into the frame. Now slide
the back into place and the frame is complete.

If you do not want to purchase a ready made frame, any good stationer
will mount your embroidered linen, or you can do it yourself and
then have it framed by a stationer. A small gilt beading made to
order will increase the beauty of the frame. In mounting follow these
instructions: cut a frame from heavy cardboard, the stiffer the
better, about 7 x 9 inches, noting the size of the linen and allowing
an inch margin on sides, top, and bottom. Cut a hole in the cardboard
for opening for picture, and proceed to mount as per directions for
"Imperial" frames. If the embroidery is not to be put under glass, cut
out another piece of thin cardboard, size of first, cover with silk,
sateen, or linen, and then sew front and back together on sides and
bottom, leaving enough space at top to slip in the picture. Use white
silk and make stitches as fine as possible. If you cannot obtain a
ready made easel to put on the back, make one from stiff cardboard,
covered with linen.


_Holly Photograph Frame Design No. 1._

BY AMALIA SMITH.

[Illustration: Holly Photograph Frame Design No. 1.]

    _Materials_--8 x 10 inch Frame: Corticelli Filo Silk, 1 skein each
    582, 583, 584, 586, 754, 767, 768, 781, 785. Dealers can furnish
    stamped linen of this design 10 x 12 inches. See page 92.

It would be impossible to find a more appropriate Christmas present
than this pretty Holly design, embroidered and neatly framed ready for
inserting the picture.

Berries.--Work in satin stitch similar to working jewels (see page 62),
with Corticelli Filo Silk, Red, 767, 768, using only one shade in each
berry.

Leaves.--Work solid, using Green, 781, for the edge. Shade darker
toward the midvein with 754, 582, 583, 785, 586. Make some leaves
darker than others. Work the stems and veins in 584 and 785. For
directions for mounting and framing see page 69.


_Pansy Photograph Frame Design No. 5._

INSTRUCTIONS BY ELIZABETH MOORE HALLOWELL.

    _Materials_--8 x 10 inch Frame: Corticelli Filo Silk, 1 skein each
    504, 672, 674, 676, 726, 727, 729.5, 743, 783, 785. Dealers can
    furnish stamped linen of this design 10 x 12 inches. See page 92.

"Pansies for thoughts" are always pleasant to associate with tokens of
friendship; and the needlewoman who selects this subject for her skill
may be sure that her choice will prove a welcome gift to a friend.

Pansies.--Use Corticelli Filo Silk, Purple, 726, 727, 729.5. For
another shade of purple, which will give variety, yet will combine well
with the above, take 672, 674, and 676.

Flowers.--In working the flowers use the ordinary long and short
stitch, keeping each petal with the stitches tending towards the center
of the flower; let the darkest shading be at the edge of the petal,
shading gradually to light at the base; and in several of the flowers
let the two upper petals be quite dark. More than this will give too
heavy an effect; therefore work the other blossoms in the lighter
shades, letting the veinings only, be dark. One large French knot of
Yellow, 504, will be needed in the center of each pansy.

[Illustration: PANSY PHOTOGRAPH FRAME DESIGN NO. 5.]

Leaves.--The leaves may be worked in long and short stitch, with 783
and 785, keeping the direction of the stitches toward the central
vein, but inclining downward to the base of the leaf. A careful study
of Colored Plate I (Frontispiece) will give one suggestions as to
the proper shading, and will be found as helpful as more elaborate
directions would be, although the colors are not identical with those
for this design.

Before mounting the embroidery be sure that it is well pressed; if it
has become in any way soiled, it should be carefully washed according
to the directions given on page 6. Rules for mounting and framing will
be found on page 69.


_Violet Photograph Frame Design No. 3._

DOUBLE FRAME FOR TWO PICTURES.

    _Materials_--10 × 13 inch Frame: Corticelli Filo Silk, 1 skein each

_Forget-me-not Frame Design No. 60._

BY EMMA HAYWOOD.

    _Materials_--8 × 10 inch Frame: Corticelli Filo Silk, 1 skein each
    115, 623, 624, 678, 780, 781, 782. Dealers can furnish stamped
    linen of this design, 10 × 12 inches, which allows ample margin for
    mounting. See page 92.

[Illustration: FORGET-ME-NOT FRAME DESIGN NO. 60.]

The simple Forget-me-not design for a photograph frame for a cabinet
sized photograph should be very popular. To present one's picture thus
framed to a valued friend carries with it a pretty sentiment, the
favorite little flower of heavenly blue pleading for us that we may
be remembered. The treatment is of the simplest kind. Both blossoms,
buds, and leaves are worked in satin stitch, with French knots for
the centers. The stems are in outline or stem stitch. For such small
flowers Corticelli Filo Silk should be used in preference to any other
kind of silk. Work the blossoms with 623, 624; the leaves and stems
with 780, 781, 782. A very artistic effect can also be gained by
working the blossoms with 699, 700, putting in the leaves and stems
with 107, 108, 109. Make the French knots for the centers with 115. The
buds may be of a delicate Pink, 678. Rules for mounting and framing
will be found on page 69. (Easy.)


_Jewel Photograph Frame Design No. 61._

BY EMMA HAYWOOD.

    _Materials_--8 × 10 inch Frame: Corticelli Filo Silk, 1 skein each
    105, 138, 139, 141, 142, 501, 624, 646, 647, 656, 657, 701, 702.
    Dealers can furnish stamped linen of this design, 10 × 12 inches.
    See page 92.

There has always been a great demand for embroidered photograph frames,
and recently those in simulated jewels have been among the most popular
patterns. When worked the color effect will be found very rich and
pleasing.

Leaves and Stems.--Work the leaves and stems in Olive Green Corticelli
Filo Silk. For the leaves take 138, 139, 141, and 142, shading the
spray from light to dark, working in satin stitch. Make one leaf in one
shade and the next one in another.

[Illustration: CORTICELLI GARLAND PHOTOGRAPH FRAME

DESIGN NO. 62.

COLORED PLATE XXV.]

[Illustration: CORTICELLI RABBIT DESIGN NO. 53.

COLORED PLATE XXVI.]

Jewels.--Work the three jewels at each corner to represent rubies,
using 656, 657, the darker shade for the one in the middle. Working
horizontally toward the center at top and bottom, the next group of
three jewels should represent the topaz, and for this choose Yellow,
501. Still following the scroll toward the center, work the next three
to represent the turquoise, using 701, 702; the darker shade for the
jewel in the middle of the group, the lighter shade for the one on each
side. We now come to the center of the frame. Work this group of three
jewels in Salmon Pink, 105.

[Illustration: JEWEL FRAME DESIGN NO. 61.]

For the side scrolls, begin at the center, using 701, 702. The three
jewels on each side of these work in 105, and the remaining group
between those in 105 and the corner, should be made in 624. All jewels
must be outlined with 646 or 647. Full directions for working jewels
are given in the instructions for the Jewel Centerpiece Design No.

COLORED PLATE XXV.

BY ALICE C. MORSE.

    _Materials_--8 x 10 inch Frame: Corticelli Filo Silk, 1 skein each
    124, 125, 126, 127, 503, 504, 505, 623, 624, 625, 636, 637, 638,
    639. This quantity is more than enough. Dealers can furnish stamped
    linen of this design, 10 x 12 inches. See page 92.

[Illustration: GARLAND PHOTOGRAPH FRAME DESIGN NO. 62.]

Wild Roses.--Work the petals solid with Corticelli Filo Silk, beginning
at the edge with 639, shading towards the center with 638, 637, 636.
Work the petals that seem to be in the background darker than those
that overlap them. Vary the shading in some of the flowers. In the
center work a few French knots with 505. See Colored Plate XXV.

Forget-me-nots.--Work in satin stitch each petal or all petals in one
flower in one shade of Blue, 623, 624, 625. Place one French knot in
the center of the open flowers, using Yellow, 503.

Ribbon.--Work in satin stitch, in Yellow, 503, 504, slanting the
stitches across the ribbon. Be careful to preserve the correct effect
of the twisted part by working one side of the fold in 503, the next
fold in 504, and so on. See Colored Plate XXV.

Leaves.--Work in satin stitch, using Green, 124, 125, 126, 127, making

_Jonquil Photograph Frame Design No. 63._

BY ELIZABETH MOORE HALLOWELL.

    _Materials_--8 x 10 inch Frame: Corticelli Filo Silk, 1 skein each
    502, 503, 504, 506, 507, 750, 751, 752, 781, 782, 783, 783.5, 784.
    Dealers can furnish stamped linen of this design, 10 x 12 inches.
    See page 92.

[Illustration: JONQUIL PHOTOGRAPH FRAME DESIGN NO. 63.]

For an Easter greeting, or a birthday present in early spring, a frame
worked in this design will prove a welcome offering. This design may
also be used for a magazine or book cover.

Flowers.--These may be worked in long and short stitch, or half solid
Kensington, in which case somewhat less than the quantity of silk
named above will be sufficient. However, we strongly advise working
the whole design in solid embroidery, as the effect is very handsome
and will repay one for the extra labor. Begin working the edge of the
cup with Yellow, 504, gradually shading darker to the base with 506,
507, keeping the stitches perfectly straight. Work the edge of petals
in Yellow, 502, and shade darker with 503, 504, to the cup. That part
of the flower between cup and stem should be worked in 506 and 507.
The curious paper-like shell which surrounds the flower at the point
of attachment to the stem, work with 750, 751, 752, using 750 for the
point, and shading darker to the stem.

Leaves.--Work solid, beginning at the point with 781, shading gradually
darker to the base, using 782, 783, 783.5, 784. Work the stems solid in
Olive Green, 782, 783, 783.5, 784, shading from dark near the bottom to
light nearest the flowers. A little of 782 should be worked at one side
of some of the stems.

Opening.--Outline the opening for the picture and the other straight
lines in the design with Yellow, 507. Rules for mounting and framing
will be found on page 69. (Not Difficult.)




_Corticelli Doily Book._


    _Materials_--Corticelli Filo Silk: 3 skeins each of two shades.
    (See below.) 1 piece linen, either Blue, Green, Tan, or Terra
    Cotta, 12 x 20 inches, stamped with this design; 1 Doily Book.
    Dealers can furnish all the above material. See page 92.

    For Blue Linen use Corticelli Filo Silk, Yellow, 741, 743.5, or
    Pink, 678, 680.

    For Green Linen use Corticelli Filo Silk, Green, 693, 695, or
    Purple, 650, 651.5.

    For Tan Linen use Corticelli Filo Silk, Scarlet, 537, 539, or Pink,
    572, 573.5.

    For Terra Cotta Linen use Corticelli Filo Silk, Pink, 635.5, 638,
    or Green, 124, 127.

    When working either Blue, Green, or Terra Cotta Colored Linen the
    proper color numbers can easily be substituted in the following
    instructions.

[Illustration: CORTICELLI DOILY BOOK.]

Every needleworker usually has several choice doilies that when not in
use should be kept in some clean place where they will remain smooth
and flat. This book holds twelve doilies. It contains thirteen leaves
of tinted cardboard, each measuring 8-1/2 by 8-1/2 inches. The covers
are stiff and the binding is strong.

Tan Linen and Scarlet Silk.--For the word "Doilies" use the darkest
shade (539) Corticelli Filo Silk. First stuff the letters with
embroidery cotton (or better still with Corticelli Roman Floss of same
shade as silk) similar to the manner of working jewels. (See page 62.)
Then cover the filling in satin stitch. The letters should appear as
if raised. Work the four corner figures with long and short stitch in
two shades of silk, using the lightest (537) for the outside and the
darkest (539) for the inside, which includes the dot in the center.
Work the stem or scroll in outline stitch in the lightest shade (537),
and make the leaves running from it solid, in long and short stitch,
with alternating shades of silk. The jewels in the scroll and the four
just inside it should be first stuffed and then covered similar to the
letters in the word "Doilies."

When completed, stretch the linen firmly over the stiff pasteboard
covers and glue down on the inside. Sew two short ribbons, the color of
the silk, to the linen on the inside, for tying the covers together.
(Not Difficult.)


_Initials and Monograms._

BY DELLA V. WHIPPLE.

[Illustration]

The newest way for marking handkerchiefs is one's own writing
transferred with carbon, then worked in a very narrow satin stitch,
with a decided slant to the stitches. The accompanying monogram is a
pretty and practical one. Embroider the single lines same as described
above, fill in the broad portions with perpendicular stitches, piling
high, and cover with satin stitch same slant as the lines. Make the
dots in French knots. If one is partial to French knots a good way is
to outline all of the lines of letters, using Kensington outline stitch
and fill in the broad parts with the knots.

The initial letters shown on the opposite page were drawn for 1898
Corticelli Home Needlework by a St. Louis artist. They are specially
adapted to the purpose for which they are intended and are very pretty
when worked according to the following instructions.

All letters look best if given a raised effect. To do this stuff the
space between the lines with Corticelli Roman Floss, after the manner
of working jewels (see page 62), taking care to have the stitches of
the filling laid in the opposite direction to that which the covering
stitches will take. With two threads of Corticelli Filo Silk cover the
stuffing in satin stitch. Color 615, White, is usually used, although
some prefer Cream White, 616, or Cream, 616.5. The Roman Floss used for
stuffing should be of the same shade as the Filo Silk. A pretty way
for making very small letters is to just follow the outline with small
cross stitches.


_Marking Clothing._

While the neatest way to mark clothing is by one's initials embroidered
in Corticelli Filo Silk, as above suggested, this is not practical
for many articles. Tablecloths, napkins, sheets, pillow cases, white
spreads, towels, shirts, collars, and cuffs, also, must be plainly
marked for convenience in sorting and identifying personal articles
in the family wash and to avoid being lost when entrusted to public
laundries. For this nothing is better than Payson's Indelible Ink. With
a bottle of this ink and a common pen one can easily mark all necessary
articles. A good idea is to keep on hand a few yards of linen tape, on
which your name is written many times with this ink. Cut the tape as
wanted and sew on to stockings, or other articles having too rough a
surface for pen work.

[Illustration: _Corticelli Initial Letters._

See opposite page for directions for embroidering.

The original letters from which the above engravings were made measure
1-1/4 inches high. If the size shown above is large enough for your
work transfer the letters direct from the book to the linen with carbon
paper. If, however, the larger sized letters are desired get your
dealer to order the perforated pattern for you, or, if he refuses to do
this send direct to the Nonotuck Silk Co., Florence, Mass. Perforated
pattern of the entire set of twenty-six letters, 1-1/4 inches high,
costs 20 cents, postpaid. Perforated patterns of single letters cost 10
cents each, postpaid.]

[Illustration: COSMOS TEA CLOTH DESIGN NO. 437 B.]

_Cosmos Tea Cloth Design No. 437 B._

DRAWN WORK AND HEMSTITCHED EDGE.

    _Materials_--Tea Cloth 45 × 45 inches: Corticelli Filo Silk, 6
    skeins each 655.7, 655.8; 5 skeins 655.9; 4 skeins 616.5; 2 skeins
    each 109, 110, 123, 504, 506, 781, and 782. The smaller size takes
    less silk. Dealers can furnish hemstitched stamped linen of this
    design, with drawn work edge, in two sizes as follows: 436 B, 36×36
    inches; 437 B, 45×45 inches. See page 92.

Flowers.--Work solid. For the edge of petals use 655.7, 655.8, shading
lighter gradually to the center with 616.5, 123. Give a touch of Pink,
655.9, to some of the petals to give an effect of shadow where the
petals lap; but not too much, as the flowers should be quite pale. In
the center work a number of short stamens with Green, 781, and make
French knots at the points of stamens in Yellow, 504 and 506. Work the
buds and half flowers in the same manner, although choose the darker
shades for the very small buds. Work the upper part of calyx with
Green, 781, and the part near the stem with 782.

Leaves.--Slant the stitches downward as you would to work stems. Tip
the points of the leaves with Green, 781, shading gradually darker
toward the stems with 782, 109, 110. Work the stems with 109, 110. (Not
Difficult.)


_Sweet Pea Tea Cloth Design No. 407 G._

HEMSTITCHED AND SILK CORDED EDGE.

COLORED PLATE XXVII.

(See Illustration on Page 81.)

BY AMALIA SMITH.

    _Materials_--Corticelli Filo Silk: 2 skeins each 501, 502, 503,
    616, 616.5, 678, 679, 680, 681, 725, 726, 727, 729, 757, 780, 781,
    782, 783, 784. Dealers can furnish hemstitched stamped linen of
    this design, 36 × 36 inches. See page 92.

Sweet peas grow in such a variety of exquisite colorings that the
utmost license is available in selecting the colors for each flower.
However, be careful to avoid startling combinations. The following
suggestions for a color scheme will be found to give a very pretty
effect.

Flowers.--Work solid, being careful to start the stitches in the
right direction. Begin the edge of the petal with a dark shade, shade
gradually lighter to the stem. The stitches should be taken in a
downward curve to the stem. Make some flowers pink on the edge and
yellow near the stem; make others shade from pink to violet; still
another flower violet and yellow, and again working some all of one
color, shading from dark on edge to light near the stem. Work the calyx
in Green, 781, 782, the darker shade near the stem.

Leaves.--Work solid, using Green, 781, 782, 783, 784, making the points
of the leaves light and shading darker near the center, using two
shades in a leaf. Make the larger leaves near the base of the spray in
the darker shades of green. Use 757 for the stems. For tendrils choose
780 and 781.

Carefully examine Colored Plate XXVII. This shows the proper stitch
direction and the shading of the flowers and leaves. Unless you
thoroughly understand "long and short" stitch and "feather stitch,"
make a study of the article on "Embroidery Stitches--Described and
Illustrated," especially of pages 11 and 12. (Difficult.)

the petals of the roses may be worked "half solid," using the long and
short stitch. The leaves also can be worked in the same manner. The
more effective way, however, is to work both roses and leaves solid,
as described in the instructions to which reference is given.

This pillow is a pretty one for summer use. The material is plaid
cambric, a white ground with a colored check. The check comes in three
different colors: green, yellow, and blue.

[Illustration: SHOWING METHOD OF WORKING SOFA PILLOW.]

The engraving shows exactly how the work is done, using the lighter
shade of silk and the seamstress' feather stitch for the four corners
around each square. The center figure is worked in the darker shade of
silk, with the X in the lighter shade. When the decoration is complete,
finish the pillow as follows: Gather the ruffle double on the raw edge,
and, putting it between the front and back pieces of the cushion, sew
together on the wrong side on three sides of the pillow. Blind-stitch
the fourth side after the down cushion has been placed inside. Other
figures and methods of working will suggest themselves to every
needleworker. This pillow is a very inexpensive one. (Easy.)




_Bicycle and Golf Stockings._


[Illustration: PATTERN A, WITH STRAP.

(The Stocking Leg shows the light brown mixed yarn.)]

The increasing popularity of the wheel and the game of golf has revived
the interest in knitting, especially since desirable and exclusive
patterns in bicycle and golf stockings are not easily obtained in the
ready made goods.

The designs given here are knit from wool and silk. The silk is made
especially for this work and in combination with wool the effect is
very handsome. The best results can only be secured by the use of the
exact material called for in the instructions. Corticelli Bicycle and
Golf Silk is made of specially selected stock dyed in fast colors,
and will be found easy to knit. Fleisher's German Knitting Worsted,
Golf and Cycle Mixtures, is just the right size to use in connection
with the silk. To identify this yarn look for the name "Fleisher's"
on the ticket attached to each hank. The colors of silk to go with
the different colors of yarns harmonize perfectly. Ordinary yarn, _no
matter of what kind or color_, will not do to work these patterns.

Those who do not care to knit the complete stocking can make the tops
alone. These are frequently made separate, but the stocking (purchased
at any store) on which they are put should not be cut, but the top
sewn on just in place to turn over in the right position. The extra
thickness is no disadvantage, in fact, rather the contrary. This
suggestion is entirely practical, especially since stockings with fancy
tops and plain legs are now the vogue.

Care must be taken to knit the top of stockings quite loosely, allowing
plenty of slack in the thread especially when changing from silk to
yarn and vice versa. Without this slack the tops of Patterns B and C
will not give or stretch, making it difficult to draw them on and off.
To knit these patterns four No. 13 steel needles are required. The
quantity of silk and yarn necessary for each pair of stockings is given
on the following pages. Among the twelve patterns will be found one
which cannot fail to suit every individual taste as to the proper color
combinations of yarn and silk.


EXPLANATION OF TERMS AND ABBREVIATIONS.

K--Knit plain.

P--Purl (or seam). Knit with thread before the needle.

N--Narrow, and means to knit two stitches together.

PN--Purl (or seam) two stitches together.

SL--Slip a stitch from the left needle to the right without knitting it.

SL and B--Slip and bind, that is slip one stitch, knit the next, and
pass slipped stitch over.

to =40th= rounds, k plain Yarn;--=41st= and =42d= rounds, p Yarn. This
completes the top.

=_To Knit the Leg._=--Knit 3 rounds plain, then purl 1, k 1 for 2
inches. Now turn the stocking inside out and proceed to knit the leg
by the instructions given below. (The part just knitted forms the turn
over top of stocking. It will be wrong side out while the leg is being
knitted, but turns over right side out when the work is completed as
shown by the engraving.)

[Illustration: STOCKING TOP OF PATTERN A.]

Purl 3 rounds, knit 15 rounds plain; then p 1, k 4 all around; knit
this way for 3 inches. The narrowing begins at the center rib of the
back of the stocking and ends at the center rib in the front of the
stocking. Make the first or center back narrowing as follows: on one
of the needles which begins, p 1, k 4, purl the purled stitch, k 1, sl
1, k 1, pass slipped stitches over and k 1. This completes the first
narrowing and the rib now consists of 1 purled stitch and 3 plain ones
only. All the narrowings are made the same way. * Knit 3 rounds. In
the fourth round knit to the rib preceding the narrowed center rib and
narrow that rib as before; then knit to the rib, following the narrowed
center rib, and narrow it; also repeat from *, always narrowing in
every fourth round at each side of the previous narrowing until all the
ribs, including the front center one, are narrowed. After knitting 4
inches more the leg is complete, and you are ready to begin the strap
or the foot.

The strap is commonly used on bicycle and golf stockings although some
prefer the complete foot. Below we give directions for knitting both.

=_To Knit the Strap._=--Divide the stitches into two parts for the
strap, making the division at the center back, and center front ribs.
Beginning at the center back rib, * k 1, n, knit across the needle
till but 3 stitches are left, sl and b, k 1; turn, purl back across
the needle, repeat three times from *. After this do not to sl and b
at the end of the needle but continue to narrow at the beginning of
the needle each time in knitting across, till the number of stitches
is decreased to 16. Then knit the other half of the strap to match, as
follows: beginning at the center front rib *k 1, n, knit across the
needle till but 3 stitches are left, sl and b, k 1, turn, purl back
across the needle, repeat three times from *. After this do not narrow
at the beginning of the needle, but continue to sl and b at the end of
the needle till the stitches are decreased to 16.

Now fold the right sides of the two parts just knitted together; k 1,
then k 2 stitches (one from each needle) together and bind the stitch
previously knitted over them; continue till all the stitches are bound
off. Work in single crochet once around the edges of the strap to give
extra strength.

=_To Knit the Foot._=--Divide the stitches so that there will
be 34 stitches on one needle for the heel. Decrease 3 stitches, and
keeping the center back stitch in the center of the heel, knit plain on
the right side and purl back on the wrong side until there are 15 loops
at each side. Then knit across 19 stitches, n, k 1, turn, sl 1, purl
back 9 stitches, n, p 1, turn, * sl 1, k across, knitting the stitch
following the last narrowing together with the next of the stitches
left on the needle; k 1, turn, sl 1, purl back and purl the stitch
following the last narrowing together with the next stitch, purl 1;
repeat from * until all the stitches on each side of the needle are
used.

Pick up the 15 loops on each side of the heel for stitches. Place the
stitches of the instep on one needle and the stitches of the sole on
two more needles; work to the beginning of the first sole needle, k 1,
n; knit across to within 3 stitches of the end of the 2d sole needle,
n, k 1; repeat the narrowing in every other round till the number
of stitches is decreased by 18. Then k 24 rounds without narrowing,
continuing the ribs along the instep. Now knit one round narrowing 7
times across instep. Then knit 2-1/2 inches plain and narrow at the
toe, as follows: place half the stitches on the instep needle and the
other half on the two sole needles; at the beginning of the instep
needle k 1, n, k across to within 3 stitches of the end of the needle,
n, k 1; first sole needle k 1, n, knit to within 3 stitches of the end
of second sole needle, n, k 1; narrow in this way in every other round
until 12 stitches are left on the instep needle and 6 on each of the
sole needles.

Bind off in this way, k 1, then knit 2 stitches together (one from the
sole and one from the instep needle) and bind the stitch previously
knitted over them; continue till all the stitches are bound off.

_For Beginners in Needlework._


_Corticelli Color Card._

To obtain the greatest benefit from using this book one should have
a Corticelli Color Card, showing the 325 different colors in which
Corticelli Filo Silk is made. With this card you can see at a glance
the exact colors of silk called for in the instructions. We will send a
Corticelli Color Card to any address for 12 cents in stamps.


_Teachers' List._

We have prepared a list, which includes many of the best teachers
throughout the United States, and to any of our readers desiring
instruction in Art Needlework we shall be glad to recommend a competent
teacher in your city or vicinity, qualified to give lessons to private
pupils and to classes. Often-times where there is no teacher in a town
one will be glad to come from a neighboring city if a small class can
be formed so as to make it an object for the teacher. In this way the
expense to each member of the class would be comparatively small.


_To Teachers of Art Needlework._

Teachers of Art Needlework who are pleased with this book and wish
information regarding our goods are invited to write for prices or
samples. Our line of stamped linens is large, and varied enough to suit
all tastes, and we are constantly issuing new designs. We have the
helps such as every teacher wants for her pupils, instruction books,
Color Cards, Colored Flower Plates, etc., and we think our co-operation
cannot fail to increase your business. Feel at liberty to write us at
any time. Questions gladly answered.

Any teacher may have her name added to our Teachers' List (see above)
upon filling out a blank giving name and address, experience, usual
prices charged for lessons, and other necessary information. Copies of
this blank will be sent free on application. Address

NONOTUCK SILK COMPANY, BRIDGE ST., FLORENCE, MASS.


To Obtain the Ready Stamped Linens and Corticelli Silk.

All designs shown in this book, as well as Corticelli Wash Silk for
embroidering them, can be obtained from dry goods stores or fancy goods
stores ready stamped on good quality round thread bleached linen. If
merchants do not have these stamped linens in stock they will order
them for you if you specially request them to do so. If one should
refuse, try another dealer, or write direct to us, giving the dealer's
name, and we will give you the name of a dealer in your vicinity from
whom you can purchase what you want.

The above remarks apply to all doilies, centerpieces, tea cloths, tray
cloths, and stamped linens for photograph frames, as well as to the
yarn and silk required for knitting bicycle and golf stockings.

Be particular to see that you get the exact patterns illustrated in
this book. Most dealers keep them. In any case it will pay you to
insist upon having these original patterns and Corticelli Silk in order
to take advantage of the treatment of the designs given herein. We will
not hold ourselves responsible for failure if other material, either
linen or silk, than that called for in the instructions is used for any
design.

We shall be glad to estimate the cost of stamped linen and silk for any
design shown in the book. Please inclose a 2 cent stamp for reply.

=The Imperial Passepartout Frame=, described on page 69, is sold
by nearly all dealers in fancy goods and embroidery materials. If your
local dealers do not keep these frames, and decline to order one for
you, we will give you the name of a dealer who will supply you.

=The Corticelli Doily Book=, described on page 75, can be obtained
in the same manner as the Imperial Passepartout Frame.


_Caution in Washing Art Embroideries._

While we guarantee the dyes used for Corticelli Wash Silk are fast in
color when ordinary care is taken in the laundrying, we cannot be held
responsible for the result when even so small a quantity as a single
skein of some other kind of silk has been used in connection with
Corticelli Wash Silk to embroider any design. Needleworkers should use
the greatest caution in this particular and avoid taking any chances.

In the washing be careful to use a good soap, like the Ivory, for
instance, which is always satisfactory. "Washing powders," liquids, or
chemicals of any nature should be let severely alone. Before beginning
read the article by Mrs. Wilson on "To Wash Embroidered Linens," page
6. Mrs. Wilson gives some valuable suggestions which all our readers
will be glad to profit by.

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
